Day 2 : 5/4/22 - "Last class I planned out my project. Fot this class I hope to get started and hopefully get to a good distance. Getting a title and the questions of my games down"

Day 3: 5/11/22 - A little after class I got the link for my images. Today I would like to have me questions mapped as well as my photos and my submit button going.

Day 4: 5/18/22 - Got quite a bit done today. We made the buttons clickable and for it to go on to the next question. We also made a demo ending page, which we are currently still working on, and I created another file to hold all the cake results depending the users choice. But other than that, it is almost done.
